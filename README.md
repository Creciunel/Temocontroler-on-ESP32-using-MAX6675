<h1>Temocontroler on ESP32 using MAX6675</h1>

<p>This project is designed to measure temperature in both a room and a thermal reactor, and to set the temperature by controlling the current through a PID-controlled triac, which is directed through galvanic isolation by an MOC3052.</p>

<p>The device is capable of controlling a load connected to 220V.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="img/WebInterface2.png" alt="Web Interface" width="150"></p>

<p>It includes a web interface that can be accessed on the local Wi-Fi network, hosted on an ESP32 microcontroller.</p>

<p>Actual cod is in folder v.0.1 <a href="V.0.1/MCUCod/MCUCod.ino"> MCUCod </a></p>

<p>The circuit and PCB design can be found on EasyEDA:</p>

<p>This project also features an application for use via USB from a PC or Bluetooth, providing versatile control options.</p>

<p>The circuit design takes into account the form and size of the case for practical implementation.</p>
